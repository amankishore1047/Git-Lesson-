ls -a -> to check wether the the git repo is being created or not.


1.  git init -> this is for initilising the git repository or we can initialise the project folder as repository.


2.  git status -> helps to check the status.

3.  git add filename -> it helps to add the file to the staging area.
 (OR)   git add . -> all the untraced or the modified files will come to staging area.

4.  git commit -m "initial commit" -> it is for commiting the file to git.

5.  git log -> to check all the old commits or previous commit.

6.  git checkout hashcode -> it will help us to go to the file before commit.

Branch concept.

8.  git branch branchname -> new branch 'branchname' is created.
9.  git branch -> it will display all the branch name.
10. git checkout branchname -> it will switch the branch to branchname.
11. git checkout -b branchname -> new branch will be created and checkout to that new branch.
12. git merge branchname -> it will merge the branchname to the current branch.

Files which you dont want to post t the git echo system.

13. touch .gitignore -> a new giignore file will be created.
    if we write file name in the .gitignore file then it will not be visible to git.
